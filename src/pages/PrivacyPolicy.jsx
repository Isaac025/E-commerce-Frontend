        <h2>5. Legal Bases (if you are in jurisdictions like the EEA)</h2>
        <p>
          Where applicable (e.g., under GDPR), we process your information based
          on: your consent, contract performance (filling your orders), our
          legal obligations, and our legitimate interests (improving services,

          security practices. We only store the minimum information necessary to
          complete refunds or support requests (e.g., last 4 digits, transaction
          IDs). For full card data, we rely on our payment processors and do not
          store complete card numbers on our servers.
